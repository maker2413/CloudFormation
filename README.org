#+TITLE: CloudFormation Templates

*Archived Repo*
This repo is no longer used and is left around only for reference. Please look
to [[https://www.github.com/maker2413/SquidsAWS][SquidsAWS]] for a better look at how I am managing my AWS infrastructure now.

These are the CloudFormation Templates I have made for my AWS
Environment. Currently these templates just stand up a bucket and a user for use
with my Terraform repo. Previously it was used for other various aspects of my
AWS environment and all of these templates have been moved to the deprecated
directory.

~pyenv install 3.9.1~
~pyenv virtualenv 3.9.1 cloudformation~
