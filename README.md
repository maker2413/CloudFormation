# CloudFormation Templates for SquidsAWS
These are the CloudFormation Templates I have made for my AWS Environment. Currently these templates just stand up a bucket and a user for use with my Terraform repo. Previously it was used for other various aspects of my AWS environment and all of these templates have been moved to the deprecated directory.

pyenv install 3.9.1
pyenv virtualenv 3.9.1 cloudformation
