# AWS Cloudformation Templates in SquidsAWS
These are the Cloudformation templates I am using in my AWS Environment. These Templates setup all the various features I have in my Cloud Environment (IAM roles and policies, Security Groups, EFS Drives, S3 Buckets, etc...).

# Running these templates
To run any of my templates simply step into the directory you want to run and set the necessary variables in config/#####-param.json and run the deploy necessary deploy script found in deploy/.
